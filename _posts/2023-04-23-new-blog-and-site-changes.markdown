Bullshit incoming:

### Changes
- This new blog site (blog.thatstel.la)
- `main.thatstel.la` is becoming [software.thatstel.la](https://software.thatstel.la)
  - The old address will redirect to the new one
- Deprecate socials page on [software.thatstel.la](https://software.thatstel.la) in favor of the contact links now on [thatstel.la](https://thatstel.la)
  - If you find a page that links to it, please yell at me on Fruitycord about it (or email me).
- Add blog to landing page and update link to `software.thatstel.l`.

### Fixes
- Redirect `thatsniceguy.com` to [thatstel.la](https://thatstel.la)
- Redirect `landing.thatsniceguy.com` to [thatstel.la](https://thatstel.la)
- Redirect `thatsniceguy.com/software` to [software.thatstel.la/software](https://software.thatstel.la/software)
  - Also works for subdirectories, in case it has to deal with something like `https://www.thatsniceguy.com/software/ios-shortcuts/wtfismyip`
- Redirect `main.thatstel.la` to [software.thatstel.la](https://software.thatstel.la)
  - Works for subdirectories like above
- Redirect `main.thatsniceguy.com` to [software.thatstel.la](https://software.thatstel.la)
  - Works for subdirectories like above
- Redirect `files.thatsniceguy.com` to [files.thatstel.la](https://files.thatstel.la)
  - Only the main page, any files still stored on `files.thatsniceguy.com` won't redirect yet.
- Redirect `discord.thatsniceguy.com` to [discord.thatstel.la](https://discord.thatstel.la)

### Summary

OK, you're probably wondering why I'm making all these changes.

I was bored. Okay, for real, I wanted to make the purpose of some of my sites a bit clearer, and clean up old links.

TLDR moved contact info out of main.thatstel.la, moved some other things around and I think I caught all possible cases with redirects but if not then yell at me (contact info at [thatstel.la](https://thatstel.la)) because I might have missed one or two things (i am sleep deprived and take solace in my three blahaj and Elli my beloved)
