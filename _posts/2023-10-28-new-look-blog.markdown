This is a quick post to announce that I've made some changes to this blog site:

I've implemented some of my own CSS which gives me more control over how this website looks. Thanks to that, I've been able to implement some meaningful QoL improvements for all users, and makes it feel sleeker on iPhones with notches or Dynamic Island when in landscape mode.

1. **Full dark mode support**
2. Custom accent color for links
3. Safe area support (notch/Dynamic Island support) for iPhone
4. Custom styling for details blocks

If you like how it looks, you can also use it on your own Jekyll-powered blog site if you're using the Minima theme!

You'll need to import [my `head.html`](https://github.com/ThatStella7922/blog/blob/master/_includes/head.html), and place [my `detailsstyle.css`](https://github.com/ThatStella7922/blog/blob/master/detailsstyle.css) in the root of your blog directory. For a full view of how it's supposed to look when set up, check out [the entire repository for this blog site](https://github.com/ThatStella7922/blog).

Anyways, yeah. Quick blog post for the changes made.
