Finally time to address the elephant in the room, finally feeling like I'm at a decent spot to talk about this.

You may have noticed that I haven't been doing much of anything in like a year, maybe more. Basically all I've been doing is maintenance of my existing infra and attempting to push small amounts of updates to personal projects. Barely pushing out the occasional hastily-recorded YouTube video.

## Why?

There's no real reason to it besides the fact that the past year especially has been nothing but turmoil for me emotionally. Coming out is the reason for most of that turmoil. Not because I don't like who I really am, but because of people who don't accept the new me. People who happen to be very close to me, family-wise.

I don't want to get into the details of that, but it has been brutal at times, testing the limits of what I can handle emotionally. Dealing with it is something I 100% wouldn't be able to do without [Eva's Safehouse](https://discord.crystall1ne.dev), [Fruitycord](https://discord.thatstel.la), and most of all Eva herself.

I'm in a spot where I may finally be able to move away from my sources of toxicity and closer to my Eva, because without her there would be no Stella.

I would share more details about everything here, but I think [Eva has that covered pretty well](https://crystall1ne.dev/2023/08/08/not-so-distant-futures/) already. 

Hopefully, 2024 is my year. The year where I'll be able to stop spending all my time on protecting my sense of self and start flourishing for once. For now though, I'm going to put my focus into that opportunity I have now.

Don't expect much in the way of public activity from me for a while, although of course I'll still be talking on Discord.
